# How to Run the Voice AI Agent

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v20 or later) installed on your machine.
- **npm** (comes with Node) for managing packages.
- (Optional) **Docker** if you prefer containerised execution.

## Step‑by‑step commands

1. **Install project dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm ci   # or `npm install` if you prefer
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env   # then edit `.env` with your credentials/API keys
   ```

3. **Run the application in development mode** (auto‑restarts on file changes)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server will start (by default on `http://localhost:3000`).

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build   # compiles TypeScript to `dist/`
   ```
   Then start the compiled server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Run with Docker** (if you have Docker installed)
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t voice-ai-agent .

   # Start the container (exposes port 3000 by default)
   docker compose up   # uses the provided docker‑compose.yml
   # or, without compose:
   # docker run -p 3000:3000 voice-ai-agent
   ```

## Quick sanity check
After starting the server, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the API health endpoint or the UI, depending on the project configuration.
